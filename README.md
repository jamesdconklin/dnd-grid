# dnd-grid

A react component for moving components around a configurable grid.

## Acknowledgement
This component is largely derived from the Custom Drag Layer example in
the react-dnd documentation. The main differences are expanding the Draggable
component to support arbitrary child components, reordering children so
that the last-dragged item is rendered on top, and rendering a visible
grid either above or below the children.

## Features

Positional manipulation of contained components.
Configurable grid dimensions and display.
Layer management - last moved is on top.
